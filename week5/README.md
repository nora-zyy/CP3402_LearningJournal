### Learning Activities & Resources
Week 5 of practice guided me to change 7 visible customization items. Here are the changes I made to the site style.

Here's an overview of the modifications I made:
- **Light Yellow Background:** Adjusted to a light yellow background with a color code of #f9f7d3（color:#f9f7d3）. This color choice is warm and friendly, providing a comfortable visual experience while contrasting well with the main text, enhancing the attractiveness and readability of the site.
- **Body Text Size:** The body text has been resized to 1.5rem to improve clarity and readability and highlight key information. Larger fonts make it easier for users to read and understand the content, improving the user experience.
- **Body Text Color:** The body text color is adjusted to grey(color: #abb8c3) to balance the page colors, provide good contrast and make the content stand out. Gray is a neutral color that enhances the conspicuousness of the text on the background, presenting a professional and modern look and improving the overall visual appeal.
- **A Deep Blue Color:** Hyperlinks adjusted to dark blue (color: #1d457d) improves readability and consistency, making hyperlinks more visible. Clear hyperlink colors help users quickly identify clickable elements.
- **A Bright Sandy Color for Hover：** Adjusting the hyperlink to a bright sand color (color: #799a84) on hover provides a clear visual indication that the user is interacting with the hyperlink. 
- **Button Styling：** Button Border Rounded Corner Adjustment (border-radius: 20px) increases the visual appeal of the button, making it more modern and user-friendly. 
-  **Button Color：** The background color of the button is adjusted to #b5e2cc (color: #b5e2cc) to make the button blend into the overall color scheme and keep it consistent with the website style. And the adjusted background color makes the button more prominent and attracts users to click on it.

### Content Insights
These site styling tweaks are designed to improve the user experience across the board. More prominent underlining and vivid hover colors enhance navigation appeal, while large text and calming blues direct users' attention to important details. Consistent and vibrant link colors ensure smooth messaging. A soft, light yellow background enhances the overall experience without overshadowing the content. Reorganizing and adding new content further refined the site's layout and interaction, providing a richer, more enjoyable browsing experience and hands-on experience with CSS customization.


### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
During my web aesthetics journey, I have not only practiced design, but I have gained invaluable experience with web-based technologies. While my career trajectory may not be directly related to web development or design, I have enhanced my technical acumen through in-depth exploration of the thematic elements of a website. By tweaking CSS and leveraging the resources of w3schools, I managed to implement a series of new ideas that deepened my understanding of website design. The process was not just about changing the look and feel, but also about gaining a deeper understanding of the technical details. This comprehensive learning process allowed me to become more familiar with the aesthetic aspects of a website, and allowed me to explore areas involving complex technology with greater confidence.

In summary, this journey into website aesthetics went beyond mere design tweaks and opened the doors of technology for me, giving me a more holistic view of website development and design.
