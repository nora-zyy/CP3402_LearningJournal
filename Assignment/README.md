### Learning Activities & Resources
For this assignment, I dived into WordPress, focusing on its versatility and user-friendly aspects. The learning process involved exploring various WordPress themes and plugins that align with the modern tastes of young people. Resources included WordPress tutorials and online forums.

During my exploration of WordPress, I integrated key plugins to enhance the site's functionality:

### Estimated Hours 
I started this task on December 2th, 2023 and it took me a total of an incomplete four and a half days. It started with watching videos to gain a better understanding of Joolam and watching videos to get a primer on WordPress. Secondly, there were the practical steps, which were aided by watching the videos to understand the exact steps of building a website with WorldPress, and designing and building it on my own.

### Content Insights
Transitioning to WordPress provided a unique opportunity to reevaluate the website's design and functionality. The platform's vast array of themes and plugins enabled a more creative approach, particularly in showcasing bakery products and custom gift options. This process highlighted the importance of aligning technology with user experience to meet the specific needs of a young audience.

I chose "Astra" as the theme for its sleek design and flexibility, which aligns well with the preferences of a young audience. Its responsive design, speed, and customization options made it an ideal choice over others, ensuring the website is both visually appealing and functionally robust.

In selecting a theme for the website, I considered several popular options like 'Divi', 'OceanWP', and 'Neve'. Each of these themes offers unique features such as visual drag-and-drop builders (Divi), extensive customization options (OceanWP), and lightweight, fast-loading design (Neve). However, I ultimately chose "Astra" for its exceptional balance of speed, design flexibility, and ease of use. Astra's wide range of starter templates and compatibility with various page builders made it the most suitable choice for creating a youthful and dynamic bakery website that appeals to our target audience.
