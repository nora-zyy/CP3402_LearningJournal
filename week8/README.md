## Learning Journal for Week8

### Learning Activities & Resources
Experiment Description
**Theory**: Integrating both active recall and peer teaching within a single day enhances CMS concept mastery more effectively than traditional, passive learning methods.

**Test**: My experiment involves dedicating morning sessions to active recall and afternoon sessions to teaching these concepts to peers. This daily integration contrasts with my usual method of separate, longer-duration study sessions.

**Methodology**:
- Preparation: Summarize key CMS topics for quick reference and discussion points.
  - Daily Routine:
    - Morning (9:00 AM - 11:00 AM): Engage in active recall by summarizing topics from memory.
    - Afternoon (2:00 PM - 4:00 PM): Conduct peer teaching sessions, explaining the morning's topics.
    - Evening (7:00 PM - 8:00 PM): Reflect on learning progress and note areas for improvement.
- Documentation: Keep a detailed log of topics covered, teaching methods, and self-feedback on understanding and clarity.
#### Estimated Hours
Approximately 4 hours per day
### Content Insights
Condensing active recall and teaching into a single day intensified the learning experience. The immediate transition from self-study to teaching required a deep understanding of the material and significantly improved retention.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This intensive approach to learning CMS highlighted the importance of active engagement and the value of immediate application in mastering technical skills. The ability to quickly learn and then communicate complex ideas is essential in fast-paced tech environments. This method not only solidified my CMS understanding but also developed my skills in rapid learning and effective communication, both of which are highly valued in a professional setting.
