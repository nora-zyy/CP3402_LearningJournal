## Content Overview
### Explanation about my entrepreneurship and S.M.A.R.T goals
#### Website Description
From the first week, I designed the site to be sold in a variety of bread and cake stores, but there were a lot of details that were not perfected. Therefore, in the second week of designing the website, I set the target user as young people, and due to the certainty of the target, I will add the following detailing:
- Research for young people's taste
- Self-service ordering is more efficient
- Introduce customized singles with the festivals
- Set menus (desserts and drinks)

In addition to this, during the web design process, use more page designs that are popular and liked by young people to ensure favoritism.

#### S.M.A.R.T goals of the webside
Specific: This allows young people to quickly learn about the store's new active products and special offers by browsing through a clear and unambiguous page.

Measurable: Popularity is determined by high bookings, user feedback results.

Achievable: Since young people are looking for a more efficient and interesting life, it is important to make the website design interesting as well as the new products clear and unambiguous.

Relevant: Ensure that young people are going to like it and pay more attention to the category as well as quality control.

Time-bound: Ensure that young people will like it and keep it for a certain period of time and then return to the customer to determine the taste.

With a clear understanding of the target user and the purpose of the design, Joomla was used to create the design.

## Learning Journey for Week 2
### Learning Activities & Resources
For the second week's assignment, I chose to develop a design with a similar theme to the first week, selling desserts as well as set menus through bakery. Since I updated my target audience in week 2, I designed a clear webpage for younger users that is more in line with current aesthetics and the interests of younger people, and I learned from YouTube and Bilibili.

### Estimated Hours 
I started this on November 26th, and generally divided the process into two major modules. First of all, through YouTobe and Bilibili website related videos to study, learn the Joomla interface and tools to use. This process took about a day. Secondly, I started to conceptualize and improve the page, which took a day and a half.

Since I was not familiar with Joomla at the beginning, I wasted a little bit of time in the process of practicing. But overall, the practice was interesting.


#### Content Insights
In the second week's project, I made a bakery targeting young people, and unlike the first week's project which used html, this time I had to learn Joomla from scratch. This time, the main design is to show the new products in the home page, as well as a more convenient holiday gift box, which greatly meets the needs of young people, and allows customers to continue to browse the idea.

The software was created to understand the lifestyle of young people through chatting, and then to extend the sales program that can be accepted by them. The most important task is to summarize the results and present them on the web page, which is also a technical test. It was also a big task to adjust the web page. It is important to ensure that the content, design and technology are fully integrated and harmonized.


#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Learn how to apply Joomla and how to use this software more smoothly. In addition, I had a deeper understanding of webpage creation and page design by looking back at famous webpages before creating webpages.

Through independent study, I have learned how to acquire knowledge more effectively through the Internet, and that technology and proficiency have to be acquired together, and that a lack of practice can also lead to a decrease in the efficiency of making Joomla. In addition, it is due to independent study, so the ability to rationalize the learning and progress is also improved.
