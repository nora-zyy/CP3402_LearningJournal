#### Estimated Hours
I spent 9 hours on this practical. 

#### Content Insights

-Due to HTML and CSS being the foundation of such subjects, I am placing more emphasis on laying the groundwork for them this time. Therefore, I did not choose a template for application, but wrote my own code.

-Writing smooth web pages is a test of integrity, and this exercise focuses more on computer version design. When writing code, techniques such as floating, banners, and selecting and adjusting specific element styles based on the position of elements in their parent container have been added to the webpage for its aesthetic appeal.

-During the design process, I was unable to merge images and text to look good, which is why I took a long time here. Subsequently, changes and improvements were made to the online search materials.

-The CSS style did not apply as expected, possibly due to priority issues with selectors. Therefore, it is necessary to have a better understanding of selector priority rules and ensure that design style rules work as expected.


#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

-Before creating the website, due to referencing the layout of large website pages, a rough idea was developed before production.

-Due to the trivial nature of website design, it is important to maintain good coding habits as there are many details to pay attention to.

-Due to the lack of rigorous thinking, many mistakes have been made. Therefore, I realized that having a strong design mindset will make me more proficient in web design and also a direction for effort.

-As the backend development of web design, we should focus on user needs and design with a bias towards requirements.

-Learning and practice should be carried out simultaneously. Simply watching video tutorials without hands-on production leads to low learning efficiency and no improvement in proficiency.
